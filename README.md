Advent of Code 2021 in Rust

# Delays
Precisely on the 6-7th and 13-14th of December, I will probably be late on uploading the solution due to personal business, but I will get back as soon as possible.

# Contributions
I'm not expecting contributions but if you spot something, I'd prefer that you'd open an issue.
